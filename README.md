In this repository, we provide several samples of our generated data, between others, as several samples of datasets. The purpose of this repository is to give access to some samples of our working data. Therefore, contributors can use this information to provide their contributions with respective proposals and prototypes consuming our dataset samples. It is part of the work done by [ISR-Lisboa](http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and [M-ITI](https://www.m-iti.org/), two [R&D Units](http://larsys.pt/index.php/facilities/) of [LARSyS](http://larsys.pt/). The project also involves the collaborative effort of [INESC-ID](http://www.inesc-id.pt/). Both [ISR-Lisboa](http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and [INESC-ID](http://www.inesc-id.pt/) are [Associate Laboratories](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/research-and-innovation/rd/associate-laboratories/) of [IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) from [ULisboa](https://www.ulisboa.pt/).

## Information

As far as we have to do several statictical analysis over our users, we need to address their results by calculating a set of measures. This measures will gave us a better understanding regarding how users are aiming to interact with our systems. Therefore it is of chief importance to scale this solution for a spreadsheet template-like where we can duplicate the same document and apply this group of source code to consume our data each time we need it.
